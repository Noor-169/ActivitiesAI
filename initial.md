## FEATURE

We want to create an app that provides suggestions for activities, that are stored in a static JSON file. User has the ability to filter activities according to duration in minutes/hours or type (fun/chores).

## PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS

### Core Functionality

- **Activity Database**: Load a pre-populated collection of activities from a static JSON file
- **Activity Suggestions**: Display random activity suggestions to users, possibly filtered.
- **Filtering System**: Allow users to filter activities by:
  - Duration (minutes/hours with range selection)
  - Type (fun activities vs. chores)
- **Simple Interface**: Provide an intuitive, single-page application experience

### Technical Requirements

- **Technology Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS only
- **Data Storage**: Static JSON file served with the application
- **No External Dependencies**: Self-contained application with no external libraries or APIs
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for file loading and JSON parsing operations
- **Clean Code**: ES6 standards with comprehensive documentation

### User Experience Requirements

- **Accessibility**: Design for neurodivergent users and wide audience accessibility
- **Simple UI**: Clean, minimalist interface with intuitive navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices
- **Fast Performance**: Quick loading and responsive interactions
- **Clear Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for user actions

### Data Structure Requirements

- **Activity Properties**:
  - Title/name of activity
  - Duration (in minutes)
  - Type (fun/chores)
  - Optional: description, difficulty level, required materials
- **Filter Options**:
  - Duration ranges (e.g., 5-15 min, 15-30 min, 30-60 min, 1+ hours)
  - Activity types with clear categorization
- **Fallback Data**: Default activity set if JSON file fails to load

### Functional Requirements

- **MVP Features**:
  - Display random activity suggestion
  - Filter by duration range
  - Filter by activity type (fun/chores)
  - Reset filters functionality
  - Basic activity display with essential information
- **Initial Activity Database**: Minimum 20-30 pre-defined activities across different durations and types

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Page load under 2 seconds
- **Compatibility**: Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Maintainability**: Code structure allows for easy future enhancements
- **Documentation**: README.md with setup and usage instructions
- **Future Migration**: Architecture should support easy migration to local storage when user functionality is added
