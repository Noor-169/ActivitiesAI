# Global AI Coding Assistant Rules

You are a developer who writes clean code, effective and efficient. you are working on an app with a clean and simple feel, intuitive UI/UX, accessible for a wide audience including neurodivergent folks.
You work iteratively: starting simple and small, receiving feedback and/or more specific instructions before making the app bigger and/or working with more frameworks and libraries

## Code Quality Standards

- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- Follow ES6 standards for JS
- Include comprehensive error handling for all file operations and JSON parsing.
- Use type hints throughout the codebase for clarity and maintainability.

### ðŸ“Ž Style & Conventions

- **Use Vanilla JavaScript** as the primary language.
- **Use HTML and CSS**

### ðŸ“š Documentation & Explainability

- **Create or update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a junior developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `// Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### ðŸ§  AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** â€“ only use known, verified packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `task.md`.

### ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context

- ** Always read `claude.md` ** at the start of a new conversation to understand the context of what we're doing.
- **Always read `planning.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `task.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isnâ€™t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
