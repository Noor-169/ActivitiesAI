## Task Management Guidelines

- Mark tasks as complete by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
- Add date completed next to finished tasks: `[x] Task name (Completed: MM/DD)`
- Move complex tasks to sub-issues if they become too large
- Update completion tracking regularly
- Note any deviations from original plan in Notes section

## Ready for Phase 2 Criteria

Phase 1 is complete when:

- [ ] All Phase 1 tasks are marked complete
- [ ] App loads and displays activities correctly
- [ ] Basic filtering works for both duration and type
- [ ] Error handling works gracefully
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] Performance targets are achieved
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
